# App Store System Architecture

This document outlines the architecture, components, and communication patterns for our complete app store ecosystem, consisting of three main components:

1. Backend API Service
2. Frontend (User Side) - For browsing and downloading apps
3. Frontend (Developer Side) - For publishing and managing apps

## 2. Frontend (User Side)

### Purpose
Allow regular users to browse, search, and download applications

### Key Features
- App discovery (featured apps, categories)
- Search functionality
- App details view with screenshots and description
- Download/install capability
- User reviews and ratings
- User profile and installed apps list

### Technology Recommendations
- Modern JavaScript framework (React, Vue, Angular)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- PWA capabilities for offline access

### Communication with Backend
- REST API calls to backend endpoints
- JWT authentication for user-specific features
- WebSockets for real-time notifications (optional)

### Pages Required
- Home/Discovery page
- Category browsing
- Search results
- App details
- User profile
- Install history
- Reviews management

## 3. Frontend (Developer Side)

### Purpose
Enable developers to publish, update, and manage their applications

### Key Features
- GitHub OAuth authentication
- App submission workflow
- Version management
- Analytics dashboard
- User feedback monitoring
- Team collaboration

### Technology Recommendations
- React or Next.js (for component reuse if using React on user side)
- Material UI or similar component library
- Form validation libraries

### Communication with Backend
- REST API calls to backend endpoints
- JWT authentication with elevated privileges
- Secure file uploads

### Pages Required
- Developer dashboard
- App creation/editing form
- Version management interface
- App statistics and analytics
- User feedback and reviews monitoring
- Team member management
- Profile settings

## Communication Between Components

### Authentication Flow
1. User authenticates via login form or GitHub OAuth
2. Backend validates credentials and issues JWT
3. Frontend stores JWT in secure storage (httpOnly cookies preferred)
4. JWT is sent with each subsequent request
5. Backend validates JWT on protected endpoints

### App Publication Flow
1. Developer uploads app details and binaries on Developer Frontend
2. Backend validates and stores submission
3. Admin reviews and approves app (via admin interface)
4. App becomes available on User Frontend
5. Users can download and install the app

### Data Flow
1. Backend is the single source of truth for all data
2. Both frontends communicate exclusively through the backend API
3. No direct communication between frontends

## Security Considerations

### API Security
- HTTPS for all communications
- JWT with proper expiration
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting
- Input validation

### Upload Security
- Virus/malware scanning for uploaded binaries
- File type validation
- Size limits
- Signature verification

### User Data Protection
- Password hashing
- Minimal personal data collection
- Data encryption

## Deployment Strategy

### Backend
- Containerized deployment with Docker
- Horizontal scaling for API services
- Database replication/clustering for high availability
- Consider Kubernetes for orchestration

### Frontends
- Static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3)
- CDN for global distribution
- Separate deployment pipelines for each frontend
- Feature flags for gradual rollout

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1 - Foundation
1. Complete GitHub OAuth integration in backend
2. Implement file upload capabilities
3. Basic Developer Portal with authentication and app submission

### Phase 2 - Core Features
1. Complete app version management
2. Implement app approval workflow
3. Enhance user-side frontend with reviews and ratings

### Phase 3 - Advanced Features
1. Developer analytics dashboard
2. User notifications
3. Team collaboration features

## Implementation Tips

### Backend
- Use a file abstraction layer to support different storage backends
- Implement proper transaction management for database operations
- Set up migrations for database schema changes
- Add comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Frontend (Both)
- Implement proper state management
- Use TypeScript for better type safety
- Setup CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
- Create a shared component library if using the same framework for both frontends

### Developer Experience
- Provide clear API documentation
- Implement usage examples
- Create intuitive error messages
- Offer sandbox environment for testing
